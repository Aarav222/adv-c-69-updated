            A good system of education must instill self-esteem and creativity. The methodology of education needs to change to eliminate a lot of unwanted information.

Creative methods of teaching will help children build their personalities. Creative sports and ancient techniques such as Avadhan, Meditations, Yoga, and Pranayama will go a long way. Dance and Music should also be introduced. Service is another good part of education. All facets of human life should be attended to and we can start that from a very young age. The key is to harness the ancient and being innovative with the modern.
